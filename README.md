### 1-Description
This project came about when I noticed that my apartment complex does not have a website. I didn't really have any intention of building it for *them*, although I may offer it to them anyway. But I decided to build a polished "brochure" type website just for the experience.

### 2-Technologies
  This project utilizes the following technologies:
- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
- [Magnific Popup](http://dimsemenov.com/plugins/magnific-popup/)
- [Slick.js](http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/)
- AJAX
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
- Responsive Design

### 3-Challenges
No real challenges, other than taking the time to do it. Using new libraries (Slick.js and Magnific-Popup) is always a learning experience, but their documentation is good, so no real difficulties there.
